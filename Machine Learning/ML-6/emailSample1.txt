Data science and machine learning are rapidly changing the world we live in. Imperial College London’s Master of Science in Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS) degree focuses on the core theories of these fields. By focusing on theory rather than ephemeral tools, your knowledge will remain relevant throughout your data science career.

This degree offers multiple pathways to meet the needs of students with multiple backgrounds -- both students just starting a career in data science, and those already working in Data Science. Applicants are expected to have a quantitative undergraduate degree in a subject like Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Statistics, or Mathematics.

Applications may close before the due date if the programme spaces fill. So we encourage applications to be submitted as early as possible.
